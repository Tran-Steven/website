# Steven Tran Portfolio Website

## Inspiration

I was largely inspired by Apple's UX & UI design used on their website, and I wanted to create something fun during school breaks.. So, the result of that was this portfolio website.

## Contact

There is a contact form on my website, but if you want to contact me directly (you can offer me some tips on CSS or frontend in general, I won't be offended) you can reach out to me here.
